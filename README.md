## Developement Roadmap

v1.x

we will create extensions to the wr-wordpress-starter template that will live inside this package in the future. 
we establish new concepts to use inside the constraints of Timber and Lumberjack

v2.x 

eventually we will create our own framework, because the extensions and new concepts will surpass the 
functions we need from the framework. following the basis of lumberjack we will create a framework
that tries to mimick Laravel albeit beeing a bit more opinionated and catered to our development needs.
